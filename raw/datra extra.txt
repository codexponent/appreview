5) Pepsi Pass
Pepsi brings you an app that makes hanging out with your friends even more rewarding—Pepsi Pass. It works with Facebook and automatically gives you points when you’re with friends who have the app, too. Hang out with one Pepsi Pass friend and you’ll earn points. Hang out with a whole bunch, and you’ll all get points. All without having to check-in at all. As long as your phones are on, the app will do the rest.

Capturing codes from specially marked Pepsi products gets you points, too. Just look for the Pepsi Pass logo on 20 oz bottles, 16 oz cans, and on Pepsi fountain cups.

If you stop by a Pepsi Pass partner location with a Pepsi Pass friend, or two, or twenty you could get extra points for that, too. Remember, the focus is on fun, so get together with your Pepsi Pass friends and rack up the points together. 

And what are the rewards you can earn? Epic stuff you can’t get anywhere else, like concert tickets, getaways, and exclusive events! The only thing harder than deciding what to redeem points on will be choosing who to share your reward with.

Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pepsi Pass uses your location so you can get points when you hang out with Pepsi Pass friends.

4)Real Estate
New Jersey's hazy indie rockers Real Estate feature Titus Andronicus' Martin Courtney, Etienne Duguay (who also records as Predator Vision), Alex Bleeker, and Matthew Mondanile, also of Ducktails. The foursome had played together in bands — including a Weezer cover band — during high school, but didn't become Real Estate until Courtney returned to the Garden State after attending college in Olympia, Washington. After forming in summer 2008, the band began playing live that fall and released the Suburban Beverage 7", which introduced Real Estate's brand of surfy, lo-fi pop, early in 2009. A song on the Underwater Peoples Records Showcase and the Fake Blues EP appeared that summer; the band spent the fall touring with Girls before its self-titled debut was released by Woodsist. The quartet joined the Domino Records roster in 2011 for its sophomore album, Days, which hit the shelves that fall. Shortly following the album's release, the band went through a line up change with Duguay dropping out, being replaced by drummer Jackson Pollis. The group was also joined at this point by auxilliary member Jonah Maurer on keyboards and additional guitars. This new assemblage of Real Estate toured feverishly on the incredibly well-received Days, though by their return in 2014 with third album Atlas, Maurer had been replaced by Matt Kallman.
